# pythonPong
 A fun, basic, Pong game created using Python programming language and the turtle module. This is a personal project to help me become more familiar with the Python language. Though this is a very basic game, Pong is a staple for a creative way to learn a new language. I still need to implement the start screen and end game/restart/close screen. Eventually I would like to add support for the top and bottom of the paddle. A way to increase and decrease the speed of the ball, and possibly some random power ups given to the last player to touch the ball to keep things creative. These could include: Speed increasing and decreasing, Longer paddle, shorter paddle for opponent, Negating a point, etc. 
Currently: Game plays smoothly. Plays sound when the ball bounces and when a score takes place. 
           Keeps score and updates correctly on the scoreboard. 
           First user to get 5 points, wins.
           
Feel free to fork and countinue to development or even commit to the program to make changes.

Cheers, Happy Coding!
